# HMV-CLI (Rust)

### HackMyVM Advanced Versatile Operations CLI Toolkit

**HMV-CLI** is a modern toolkit designed specifically for the HackMyVM community. It lets you search for machines, download VMs, submit flags, and view community writeups efficiently, directly from your terminal.

Since **v0.7.0**, running `hmv` opens the **interactive dashboard (TUI)** — that is the primary interface. The classic CLI subcommands (`hmv stats`, `hmv machine ...`) remain fully available for scripting and one-liners.

This is the **Rust rewrite** of the original Python [HMV-CLI](https://github.com/setyanoegraha/hackmyvm-commandlineinterface) — a single static binary, no Python runtime required.

## Key Features

* **Dashboard-first**: bare `hmv` opens the interactive TUI dashboard — your stats, accepted writeups, pending writeups, the full machine catalog and downloads in one screen.
* **First-run config popup**: no manual setup — the dashboard walks you through account configuration on first launch (or when the stored password stopped working).
* **Secure Auth**: credentials are stored using the system vault (Linux keyutils / Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain) via the `keyring` library. Only the username and your last download folder touch `~/.hmv/config.json`.
* **Personal Statistics** (`hmv stats`): rank, title, country, points, roots/users, challenges, writeups, trophies and visual progress bars per difficulty.
* **Machine Management**:
    * Smart paginated machine listing (max 3 concurrent page fetches).
    * Instant machine search by name.
    * Filters for difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced) or OS (linux/windows).
    * Global "Pwned" status synchronization to track your progress.
    * Upcoming machine **release schedule** (`hmv machine -r`).
* **High-Speed Downloader**: Downloads VMs directly from MEGA with accurate progress bars — up to **2 VMs in parallel** (`-d a -d b`). Files are decrypted on the fly (AES-128-CTR) and **integrity-verified with the MEGA per-chunk MAC** before being moved out of the `.part` staging file.
* **Flag Submission**: Submit flags with clear visual feedback — including **dual user/root flag submission** in one command (`-f <user> -f <root>`, max 2, concurrent).
* **Writeups Access**: View community writeups (articles or videos) without opening a browser. **Submit your own writeup** directly (`-w --upload <url>`) once both flags are pwned.

---

## Prerequisites

* **OS**: Linux (primary target for v0.2.0; Windows/macOS builds should work but are untested).
* An active account on [HackMyVM](https://hackmyvm.eu/).
* A Secret Service provider on Linux (e.g. GNOME Keyring / KWallet) for credential storage.

## Installation

### 1. From source (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/setyanoegraha/hmv-cli-rust.git
cd hmv-cli-rust
cargo install --path .
```

### 2. From git directly

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/setyanoegraha/hmv-cli-rust.git
```

> Requires the Rust toolchain (1.85+): https://rustup.rs

## First Setup

Nothing to configure by hand — just run `hmv`:

```bash
hmv
```

On the very first run (or when the stored password no longer works) the dashboard opens a **Configure HackMyVM** popup:

1. Type your HackMyVM **username**, then press `Tab` / `↓`.
2. Type your **password** (hidden as `•••`), then press `Enter`.

Credentials are validated with a real login **before** anything is saved. If the login fails, the popup reopens with your username kept; `Esc` quits the app.

Prefer the terminal, or need to switch accounts later? Use the classic command:

```bash
hmv config
```

**Where your data lives:** the username and the last download folder are stored in `~/.hmv/config.json`; the password never touches disk — it goes into your OS vault (keyutils / Secret Service on Linux, Credential Manager on Windows, Keychain on macOS).

## Usage Guide

Two ways to drive HMV-CLI: the **interactive dashboard** (primary) and the **CLI subcommands** (scripts & one-liners). Both use the same stored account.

### 1. Interactive Dashboard — just run `hmv`

```bash
hmv
```

(`hmv tui` does the same.) Five keyboard-driven tabs:

| Keys | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Tab` / `←` `→` | Switch between **Stats**, **Writeups**, **Pending**, **Machines** and **Releases** |
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move selection |
| `g` / `Home` | Jump to the top of the list |
| `/` | Filter the current list (type to narrow, `Enter` keeps it, `Esc` clears & exits) |
| `f` | **Machines only** — flag popup with User & Root fields (fill one or both, sent in parallel). Results show in a popup (`✓ ACCEPTED` / `✗ REJECTED` per field); a data refresh runs after you close it. Status-aware: PWNED machines show a read-only "Already PWNED" box, machines with one flag in get a "one remains" notice. |
| `d` | **Machines only** — download popup: pick the destination folder (remembered across sessions), MEGA link resolved automatically, streaming download with live progress in the Downloads overlay. MAC-verified before the file lands. |
| `w` | **Machines & Pending** — community writeups popup for the selected machine: `j`/`k` to select, `Enter` opens the link in your browser, `Esc` closes. |
| `u` | **Pending only** — submit a writeup URL for the pwned machine (result popup as well). |
| `o` | Toggle the **Downloads** overlay (live gauges, speed, final paths). Closing it never stops running downloads. |
| `c` | **In the Downloads overlay** — cancel the most recent active download (the staged `.part` file is cleaned). |
| `Enter` | Open the selected writeup link in your browser (**Writeups tab** and writeups popup). |
| `r` | Re-fetch all data |
| `q` / `Esc` / `Ctrl-C` | Quit (with active downloads, the first `q` lists them — press `q` again to abort). |

- **Stats** — identity, achievements, trophies and animated progress gauges per difficulty.
- **Writeups** — every writeup accepted on HackMyVM (VM, language, link).
- **Pending** — machines you fully pwned (user + root flags) that still have no accepted writeup.
- **Machines** — the complete catalog (VM, difficulty, creator, size, status) with color-coded difficulty.
- **Releases** — the upcoming machine release schedule (RELEASED / UPCOMING).

Actions submitted from the TUI show their verdicts in a result popup that stays until dismissed (`User flag: ✓ ACCEPTED`, `Root flag: ✗ REJECTED`, ...) and trigger an automatic data refresh on close when your progress changed.

Downloads run in the background (max 2 in parallel, extra ones queue): the Downloads overlay shows live gauges, speed and the final path; downloads keep running when the overlay is closed; quitting while a download is active asks for a second `q`.

### 2. CLI for Scripting & One-liners

| Command | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hmv` / `hmv tui` | Launch the interactive dashboard. |
| `hmv config` | (Re)configure your HackMyVM account. |
| `hmv stats` | Show your personal stats: rank, points, trophies and progress. |
| `hmv machine -l` | Show the latest 20 machines (`-p <n>` for another page). |
| `hmv machine -a` | Show the entire machine catalog in one large table. |
| `hmv machine -n <name>` | Search for machines by name (e.g., `hmv machine -n hunter`). |
| `hmv machine -s <filter>` | Filter / sort by category: `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`, `linux`, `windows`, `size`, `hacked`, `all`. |
| `hmv machine -r` | Show the upcoming machine release schedule. |
| `hmv machine -d <name>` | Download a machine by name (e.g., `hmv machine -d victorique`). |
| `hmv machine -d <a> -d <b>` | Download two machines in parallel. |
| `hmv machine -v <name> -f <flag>` | Submit a flag (e.g., `hmv machine -v fuzzz -f flag{abc}`). |
| `hmv machine -v <name> -f <f1> -f <f2>` | Submit user & root flags concurrently. |
| `hmv machine -v <name> -w` | View community writeups for a machine (e.g., `hmv machine -v skid -w`). |
| `hmv machine -v <name> -w --upload <url>` | Submit your writeup link for a machine (requires both flags submitted). |

## Updating

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/setyanoegraha/hmv-cli-rust.git --force
```

### Uninstallation & Cleanup

```bash
cargo uninstall hmv
```

Cleaning up Remaining Data

HMV stores configuration in the `~/.hmv/` directory and the password in the system vault. Delete the folder (and the `hmv-cli` keyring entry) to clear all local data:
- Linux: `~/.hmv`

## Security Notes

* No HackMyVM or MEGA credentials are ever sent to MEGA — public-file downloads use MEGA's anonymous API.
* Downloaded archives are AES-CTR decrypted in a streaming fashion and verified against the MEGA MAC embedded in the file key; corrupt/interrupted downloads are rejected and never leave a partial `.zip` behind.
* All traffic uses HTTPS (MEGA storage URLs are upgraded from `http://` to `https://`).

# HMV-CLI (Rust)

### HackMyVM Advanced Versatile Operations CLI Toolkit

**HMV-CLI** is a modern command-line toolkit designed specifically for the HackMyVM community. It allows you to search for machines, download VMs, submit flags, and view community writeups efficiently directly from your terminal with fast performance and an intuitive interface.

This is the **Rust rewrite** of the original Python [HMV-CLI](https://github.com/setyanoegraha/hackmyvm-commandlineinterface) — a single static binary, no Python runtime required.

## Key Features

* **Secure Auth**: Securely stores your credentials using the system vault (Linux keyutils / Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain) via the `keyring` library. Only the username touches `~/.hmv/config.json`.
* **Machine Management**:
    * Smart paginated machine listing (max 3 concurrent page fetches).
    * Instant machine search by name.
    * Filters for difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced) or OS (linux/windows).
    * Global "Pwned" status synchronization to track your progress.
* **High-Speed Downloader**: Downloads VMs directly from MEGA with accurate progress bars. Files are decrypted on the fly (AES-128-CTR) and **integrity-verified with the MEGA per-chunk MAC** before being moved out of the `.part` staging file.
* **Flag Submission**: Submit flags from the terminal with clear visual feedback.
* **Writeups Access**: View community writeups (articles or videos) without opening a browser.

## Prerequisites

* **OS**: Linux (primary target for v0.2.0; Windows/macOS builds should work but are untested).
* An active account on [HackMyVM](https://hackmyvm.eu/).
* A Secret Service provider on Linux (e.g. GNOME Keyring / KWallet) for credential storage.

## Installation

### 1. From source (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/setyanoegraha/hmv-cli-rust.git
cd hmv-cli-rust
cargo install --path .
```

### 2. From git directly

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/setyanoegraha/hmv-cli-rust.git
```

> Requires the Rust toolchain (1.85+): https://rustup.rs

## Initial Configuration

After installation, you must run the configuration command to save your account:

```bash
hmv config
```

**NOTE:** Your password is encrypted by the operating system and is not stored in plain text.

## Usage Guide

### General Commands

| Command | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hmv` | Show banner and help menu. |
| `hmv machine -l` | Show the latest 20 machines from HackMyVM. |
| `hmv machine -a` | Show the entire machine catalog in one large table. |
| `hmv machine -n <name>` | Search for machines by name (e.g., `hmv machine -n hunter`). |
| `hmv machine -s <filter>` | Sorting / Filtering the machines by some category (e.g., `hmv machine -s beginner`). |
| `hmv machine -d <name>` | Download for machine by name (e.g., `hmv machine -d victorique`). |
| `hmv machine -v <name> -f <flag>` | Submit flag for some machine (e.g, `hmv machine -v fuzzz -f flag{abc}`). |
| `hmv machine -v <name> -w` | See write-up for machine from community (e.g., `hmv machine -v skid -w`). |

### VM Interaction

* **Download VM:**
    ```bash
    hmv machine -d <vm_name>
    ```
* **View Writeups:**
    ```bash
    hmv machine -v <vm_name> -w
    ```
* **Submit Flag:**
    ```bash
    hmv machine -v <vm_name> -f <flag_token>
    ```

### Show All Machine based on Filtering & Sorting

* **By OS:** `hmv machine -s linux -a`
* **By Difficulty:** `hmv machine -s beginner -a`
* **By Size:** `hmv machine -s size -a`

### Updating

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/setyanoegraha/hmv-cli-rust.git --force
```

### Uninstallation & Cleanup

```bash
cargo uninstall hmv
```

Cleaning up Remaining Data

HMV stores configuration in the `~/.hmv/` directory and the password in the system vault. Delete the folder (and the `hmv-cli` keyring entry) to clear all local data:
- Linux: `~/.hmv`

## Security Notes

* No HackMyVM or MEGA credentials are ever sent to MEGA — public-file downloads use MEGA's anonymous API.
* Downloaded archives are AES-CTR decrypted in a streaming fashion and verified against the MEGA MAC embedded in the file key; corrupt/interrupted downloads are rejected and never leave a partial `.zip` behind.
* All traffic uses HTTPS (MEGA storage URLs are upgraded from `http://` to `https://`).
